# Supervised Learning

## Regression Algorithm

It learns to predict numbers out of infinitely many possible numbers.

## Classification Algorithm

1. Class and category are the same thing.

2. Categorys don't have to be numbers , it could be non-numeric.

## Difference between Regression Algorithm and Classification Algorithm

Classification predicts a small , finite , limited set of possible output categories such as 0, 1, and 2 , but not all possible numbers in between like 0.5 or 1.7.

Given the data set and draw the graph according to its inputs and outputs , what the learning algorithm might do is find some boundary that seperates the different classes.

# Conclusion

1. Supervised learning learns from being given "right answers".

2. Regression predicts a number out of infinitely many possible numbers.

3. Classification predict categories out of small set of possible outputs (a given data set).
