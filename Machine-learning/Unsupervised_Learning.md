# Unsupervised Learning

## Comparison with the supervised learning

1. Supervised learning learn from data lableled with the "right answers".

2. Unsupervised learning find something interesting in unlabeled data.

## Feature

1. We are not trying to supervise the algorithm to give some quote right answer for every input.

2. Instead, we ask the algorithm to figure out all by itself what's interesting or what patterns or structures there might be in the data.

## Clustering Algorithm

1. With a particular data set , the clustering algorithm might decide that the data can be assigned to 2 different groups or 2 different clusters (e.g.). And so it might decide that there's 1 cluster or group over there, and there's another cluster or group over here.

2. The clustering algorithm places the unlabeled data into different clusters. It figures out on its own, without supervision, what are the clusters of the data set.

## Anomaly detection

Find unusual data points.

## Dimensionality reduction

Compress data using fewer numbers.

# Conclusion

1. As for the unsupervised learning, data only comes with inputs x, but not output labels y.Algorithm has to find structure in the data itself.

2. The clustering algorithm which is a type of unsupervised learning algorithm, takes data without labels and tries to automatically group them into clusters. In short, it groups similar data points together.
